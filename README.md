asteroids-py
============

A variant on the classic _Asteroids_ game, developed using
[Python 2.7](https://python.org) and [PyGame 1.9](https://pygame.org) by
[David C. Drake](https://davidcdrake.com).

Controls
--------
* Accelerate forward: 'up' or 'w'
* Accelerate backward: 'down' or 's'
* Turn left: 'left' or 'a'
* Turn right: 'right' or 'd'
* Shoot: 'space' or 'enter' or 'ctrl'
* Quit: 'esc'

Asteroids occasionally drop power-ups that increase your ship's attack spread.
Once you're shooting in all directions, picking up another power-up will provide
shielding, preventing the next hit from destroying your ship.
